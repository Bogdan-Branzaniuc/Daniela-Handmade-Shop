# Bug 
///////////////////////////

- ## Error
  ![error image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgzv7gan8/image/upload/v1692038133/daniela_handmade/readme/console_errors_from_unicorn_dptenx.png)
  ![requests](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgzv7gan8/image/upload/v1692038133/daniela_handmade/readme/unicorn_error_zplkaw.png)

- ## moment of occurance
    ```
    when clicking any unicorn components buttons from **product** and **item_in_bag** components
    ```

- ## Environments it occures in 
  ```
      Production - Yes
      Localhost - No
  ```
  
- ## Cause
  ```
      Currently Unknown
  ```
- ## Possible causes:
    * Django unicorn implementation - NO, since it is working fine in localhost. 
    * Conflicts with current session that get's handled in the components
    * Conflicts between dependencies - Possible
  
- ## Repercursions:
* Due to this issue, a checksum error might occur. Checksums are strings of characters that django-unicorn uses to identify components, 
* A checksum error could have a lot of sources, but what all of them have in common is when a page get's out of Sync.  
* With the current bug I could not reproduce a checksums error by spamming the buttons for 5 minutes, but as an extra-safety measure for testing If it ever occurs, you have to delete the session_id stored in the browser application storage
  ![checksums error session_id deletion](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgzv7gan8/image/upload/v1692038110/daniela_handmade/readme/session_id_e6ffmj.png)
  
- ## Bug type
      NONFATAL
- ## Conclusion
If a button doesn't work, it can be pressed again untill it works, or the checksum error will eventualy kick in, however I couldn't obtain the checksum error by spammin the component template

# /////////////////////////// End of Bug

# /// Update on BUG
## Solved
### cause discovered:
___
Heroku is assigning only one dyno to a free hosted app, meaning that when using django-unicorn, to components are cached.
Caching in memory would only work with more than one dyno, therefore since the app has only one server, 
I could implement file-based caching in Django.
This also explains why the bug only occurred in production environment and not locally.
</br></br></br>

# Testing

## UX & UI

* I used [BrowserStack](https://live.browserstack.com/dashboard#os=iOS&os_version=14.0&device_browser=safari&zoom_to_fit=true&full_screen=true&url=https%3A%2F%2F8000-bogdanbranzaniuc-cv-xsqhgnyysr5.ws-eu87.gitpod.io%2F%23about-me&speed=1) for testing the application across multiple browsers and devices within the limit of a free trial.
* Also Tested directly on my devices:
* One+ 9 Android Chrome
* Windows Desktop Brave, Chrome, Mozila, Opera

## Manual Testing

* Admin Crud Products Tests

* Create A Product Test:
    - 01 Pressed on Add new Products content button in admin_crud_products page
    - 02 selected one of the existing categories
    - 03 added a random number as sku '14351234' 9 digits long - maximum allowed by the form
    - 04 wrote the title 'Barrette'
    - 05 wrote the description 'A handmade knitted barrette'
    - 06 set the price to 4
    - 07 uploaded an image from my computer
    - 08 selected crimson darkslateblue and limegreen colors from the selection widget
    - 09 selected size U. universal
    - 10 pressed add product
    - 11 got message 'Successfuly added product'
      
* Edit A Product Test:
    - 01 Pressed on Edit at an exisitng product
    - 02 changed it's data with another set of data that complies with the form validation
    - 03 pressed Edit Product
    - 04 got message 'Successfuly updated product'

* Delete a Product Test:
    - 01 Pressed on Delete at an existing product
    - 02 Soft Deletion mode was activated for that product component
    - 03 Pressed restore
    - 04 Soft Deletion mode was deactivated
    - 05 Pressed Delete again
    - 06 Soft Deletion mode was activated again
    - 07 Pressed Permanently delete
    - 08 the product disspeared
    - 09 got message "Successfuly deleted product"  
 
## Database Testing

* The web app was developed with a Django default database
* Tested with the default database, migrated to a production Database, and tested again with the production Database

## Unit Tests
- I decided to spend more time trying to fix the disturbing existing bug that appeard in the production environment. with no success
- Unittests following in a future version.

## Stack Overflow
* I managed to overcome a lot of issues by just going on this amazing resource with a copy paste of my errors.

## Chat GPT
* I used Chat GPT to navigate Django's main concepts, As a beginner I found it the quickest way to see how Django's Lego pieces were coming together.
* I learned to use ChatGPT mainly for general concepts rather than specifics, since it's training consists of lying and deceiving about it's current knowledge.
* Lesson I learned from Chat GPT : ```When you feel like you're chasing your tail around ChatGPT, the answer is elsewhere```

## Code Institute
* For enforcing and encouraging high standards of good practices on my projects
* For compacting and providing valuable information and know-how in their course

## Me
* For designing the architecture of the website.
* For creating a decent product that meets the requirements of both Code Institute and Daniela's Business.
* For understanding and writing all the code needed to interchange data between all the architectural parts and technologies used.
